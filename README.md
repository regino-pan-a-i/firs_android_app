# Overview

As an initial approach of programming for Andriod devices I spent time learning and understanding the basic concepts of Android Studio, xml and Java implementation, and emulators 

My app uses interaction between android app elements and Java commands to display messages to the screen, auto increment the value shown on the screen and display the new one, and finally link to a random number in a new screen.
